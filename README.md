# Elderly Fall Detection System

A computer vision-based fall detection system using MediaPipe and OpenCV for real-time monitoring of elderly individuals. This system uses pose estimation to detect human body landmarks and analyze movement patterns to identify potential falls.

## Features

- Real-time pose detection using MediaPipe
- Webcam integration for live monitoring
- Skeleton visualization overlay
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Optimized for single-person detection

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Webcam or USB camera
- For WSL users: USB camera forwarding setup (see setup instructions)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fall-detection-system.git
cd fall-detection-system
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv fall_detection_env
source fall_detection_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: fall_detection_env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Test Camera Setup

First, test if your camera is working:

```bash
python test_camera.py
```

You should see a camera feed window. If you encounter issues, see the troubleshooting section.

### 5. Run the Fall Detection System

```bash
python fall_detection.py
```

Press 'q' to quit the application.

## WSL Setup (Windows Users)

If you're using WSL2 on Windows, you'll need to forward your USB camera:

1. Install usbipd on Windows:
   ```powershell
   winget install usbipd
   ```

2. List and attach your camera:
   ```powershell
   usbipd list
   usbipd attach --wsl --busid <your-camera-busid>
   ```

3. In WSL, install camera utilities:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install v4l-utils
   ```

## Project Structure

```
fall-detection-system/
â”œâ”€â”€ fall_detection.py      # Main fall detection application
â”œâ”€â”€ test_camera.py         # Camera testing utility
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # This file
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore           # Git ignore rules
```

## How It Works

1. **Camera Input**: Captures live video feed from webcam
2. **Pose Detection**: Uses MediaPipe to detect 33 body landmarks
3. **Skeleton Visualization**: Overlays detected pose on video feed
4. **Fall Analysis**: (In development) Analyzes pose data to detect falls

## Current Status

âœ… Camera integration and pose detection  
âœ… Real-time skeleton visualization  
ðŸš§ Fall detection algorithm (in progress)  
ðŸš§ Alert system (planned)  
ðŸš§ Multi-person detection (planned)  

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Development Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add docstrings to all functions
- Test your changes with `test_camera.py` before committing
- Update README.md if you add new features

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- Check if camera is being used by another application
- Try different camera indices (0, 1, 2) in `test_camera.py`
- For WSL users, ensure USB forwarding is properly configured

### Performance Issues
- Lower the camera resolution in `setup_camera()` function
- Reduce FPS if needed
- Close other applications using the camera

### Import Errors
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement fall detection algorithm
- [ ] Add email/SMS alert system
- [ ] Support for multiple camera angles
- [ ] Machine learning model for improved accuracy
- [ ] Mobile app integration
- [ ] Cloud-based monitoring dashboard
